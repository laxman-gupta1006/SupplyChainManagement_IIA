## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install postgresql
   brew services start postgresql
   ```

2. **Create Database**
   ```bash
   psql -U laxmangupta -d postgres
   CREATE DATABASE merchant_two_supply_chain;
   \q
   ```

3. **Navigate to Merchant_two directory**
   ```bash
   cd Merchant_two
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run database migration**
   ```bash
   node migrate_to_postgresql.js
   ```

6. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or for production:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Access the dashboard**
   - Local: http://localhost:3001
   - Network: http://[your-ip]:3001

## Port Configuration
- **Default Port**: 3001 (to avoid conflict with Merchant_one on port 3000)
- The application automatically detects your network IP for external access

## API Endpoints

- `DELETE /api/products/:productId` - Delete a product

### Analytics
- `GET /api/stats` - Get dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/analytics` - Get detailed analytics data

## CRUD Operations

## Differences from Merchant One

1. **Database**: Uses PostgreSQL instead of in-memory storage
2. **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Update, Delete functionality
3. **Data Persistence**: All changes are permanently stored
4. **Enhanced Schema**: Additional fields like sustainability indices
5. **Port**: Runs on port 3001 to avoid conflicts
6. **Color Scheme**: Red-themed UI to distinguish from Merchant One's blue theme
7. **Performance**: Database optimization with indexing and connection pooling

## Network Access
The application is configured to accept connections from other devices on your network:
- Automatically detects and displays your network IP
- Other devices can access using: `http://[your-network-ip]:3001`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PostgreSQL Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and database exists
2. **Port Already in Use**: Change PORT in server.js or use different port
3. **Migration Failures**: Check CSV file formats and database permissions
4. **Network Access Issues**: Check firewall settings

### Database Issues
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running: `brew services status postgresql`
- Check database exists: `psql -l`
- Ensure proper user permissions
- Validate CSV data format before migration
