### 4️⃣ Open Your Browser

**Navigate to**: http://localhost:4000

You'll see:
- 📊 Real-time statistics from both databases
- 🔍 Natural language query input box
- 💡 Quick example queries you can click
- 🎨 Beautiful modern dark theme interface

---

## 🧪 Test It Out!

Try these queries (just type them in the input box):

### Easy Start
```
Show me total revenue from all merchants
```

### Product Search
```
List all cosmetics products
```

### Comparison
```
Which merchant has higher sales?
```

### Inventory Check
```
Show products with stock below 50
```

### Supply Chain
```
Show me all suppliers from both merchants
```

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting, verify:

- [x] ✅ **Dependencies installed** (already done: `npm install` completed)
- [ ] ⚠️ **PostgreSQL running** 
  - Check: `brew services list | grep postgresql`
  - Should show: `postgresql started`
- [ ] ⚠️ **Merchant_one database exists**
  - Test: `psql -U laxmangupta -d supply_chain_management -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products_sales;"`
- [ ] ⚠️ **Merchant_two database exists**
  - Test: `psql -U vatsaly -d merchant_two_supply_chain -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;"`
- [ ] ⚠️ **Gemini API key configured**
  - Check: Open `/Dashboard/.env` and verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` has a value

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Merchant_one database"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if database exists
psql -U laxmangupta -l | grep supply_chain_management

# If missing, check Merchant_one folder for migration script
cd ../Merchant_one
node migrate_to_postgresql.js
```

---

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Merchant_two database"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if database exists
psql -U vatsaly -l | grep merchant_two_supply_chain

# If missing, check Merchant_two folder for migration script
cd ../Merchant_two
node migrate_to_postgresql.js
```

---

### Issue: "Gemini API key not configured"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you added the key to `/Dashboard/.env`
2. Remove any quotes around the key
3. Restart the server: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm start` again

---

### Issue: "Port 4000 already in use"

**Solution**:
Edit `/Dashboard/.env`:
```env
PORT=5000
```
Then restart the server.

## 🎨 What You'll See

### Dashboard Statistics (Top Section)
- **Total Products**: Combined from both merchants
- **Total Revenue**: Aggregated revenue with breakdown
- **Average Price**: Calculated across all products  
- **Product Types**: Total categories/types

Each stat shows:
- 🟣 Purple = Merchant_one contribution
- 🩷 Pink = Merchant_two contribution

### Query Interface (Middle Section)
- Natural language input box
- "Query" button (or press Enter)
- Quick example chips (click to use)
- AI processing indicator

### Results Display (Bottom Section)
- Query explanation from AI
- SQL queries executed (for transparency)
- Side-by-side merchant results
- Color-coded tables
- Aggregated totals when applicable

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Show revenue for cosmetics" works better than "show data"
2. **Compare Merchants**: "Compare X between merchants" for analysis
3. **Use Filters**: "Show products where stock < 50" for specific data
4. **Click Examples**: Learn query patterns from the example chips
5. **Check SQL**: Review the generated SQL to understand what's happening

---

## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. **You Type**: Natural language question
2. **AI Understands**: Gemini analyzes your question
3. **AI Generates**: Creates SQL for the right database(s)
4. **System Executes**: Runs queries on both databases (if needed)
5. **Results Combined**: Aggregates and formats results
6. **Beautiful Display**: Shows everything clearly with colors

---

## 🚀 You're All Set!

**Everything is ready to go. Just 3 steps**:
1. Get Gemini API key → Add to `.env`
2. Run `npm start` in Dashboard folder
3. Open http://localhost:4000

**That's it!** Start asking questions in natural language! 🎉
